# imgui_layer
Object oriented layer above [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with a simple markup language. The aim is to make it easier for users of software using ImGui to change or develop the GUI without having to recompile the project. <br/>
"imgui_layer" is a temporary name until I find a suitable one. Feel free to share your ideas :)
